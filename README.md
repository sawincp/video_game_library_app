# Phase-4 Project Ruby on Rails
By: Corey Sawin

This is a Video Game Library application built with a React frontend and a Rails backend. This application allows a user to log in or sign up for an account and then view a profile page that will show all the video games they have added to the library. The user is able to view all the video games in the database and have the ability to add a new game. From here the user can view the details of each game in the database that will show the game cover art, release date, what platfrom the game is on, and what genre the game on. In addition, the user has the ability to create, read, update and delete any note they left for the movie they created. There are two links on the game detail page which allows the user to see all the games associated with the platform and all the games associated with the genre.
